summary of my thesis:
Communities are one of the most important aspects of complex networks. 
Communityâ€™s structure refers to the nodes in the same community that have dense connections.
There are lots of methods that exist to find communities, most of the existing methods attend to find non-overlapping
community detections, whereas some of them focus on addressing the task of overlapping community detections. 
In this paper we have proposed an approach is based on optimization. At first, all potential overlapping nodes have been found. 
Then the problem of community detection is formulated as an optimization problem,
Galaxy-based Search Algorithm uses local search (modified Hill-Climbing) and chaotic move to find better solution, 
in this essay the algorithm optimizes  normalized mutual information(NMI). 
Finally, we compare this method with existing methods,
we have used GN networks and real-world networks to evaluate our approach,
this experiment is a significant improvement on the problem of community detection.
